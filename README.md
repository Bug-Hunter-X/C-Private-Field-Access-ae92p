# Direct Access of Private Field in C#

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, coding error in C#: directly accessing a private backing field of a property instead of using the property itself. While this might seem to work initially, it can lead to several issues:

* **Broken Encapsulation:**  The primary purpose of properties is to control access to fields. Directly manipulating fields bypasses this controlled access, making your code harder to maintain and debug.
* **Inconsistent Behavior:** If the property's getter or setter performs additional logic (e.g., validation, logging, or calculations), bypassing the property means that this logic will be skipped. This can lead to unexpected or inconsistent results.
* **Maintenance Difficulties:** Changing the implementation of the property in the future might require updating every location where the field is accessed directly, making refactoring a nightmare.

**Example:** The provided `Bug.cs` illustrates this issue. `MyMethod` directly sets the `_myField`, ignoring any validation or logic within the `MyProperty` setter.

**Solution:** `BugSolution.cs` shows the corrected approach, consistently using the `MyProperty` to interact with the underlying field.
